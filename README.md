🌟 Welcome to the National History Day-California Judge Orientation! 🌟

This is 🥇Part One of the Judge Training. 🥈Part Two will be a webinar on April 11, and 🥉Part Three will be at the contest. Thank you for volunteering to judge at this year's competition. Our students are looking forward to your feedback on their projects. 🙌

As you work through the modules in this course, please be sure to engage in all of the interactive elements. You will not be able to advance through the modules unless you have completed the activities, so please watch the videos 📽️, take the quizzes ✔️, and interact with the scenarios 🖱️. Once you've completed the course, the state contest coordinators will be notified. 🚀

Thank you, again, for being a part of National History Day in California. 🌟
